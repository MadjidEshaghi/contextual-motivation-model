DATASET INFORMATION - M(p,e,env) Motivation Model
================================================

META-ANALYSIS SUMMARY
--------------------
Total observations: N=1,237 across 6 independent datasets
Time period: 2010-2024
Disciplines: Economics, Psychology, Organizational Behavior

KEY VARIABLES
------------
p: Uncertainty (0-1 scale)
  - Experimental: Risk treatment levels
  - Survey: Perceived uncertainty measures  
  - Range: 0 (certainty) to 1 (maximum uncertainty)

e: Effort investment (0-10 normalized scale)
  - Self-reported effort scales
  - Task completion time/performance metrics
  - Experimental choice variables

env: Environmental support (-1 to +1 composite index)
  - Social support (0.4 weight)
  - Institutional trust (0.3 weight)  
  - Norm alignment (0.3 weight)
  - Negative: Stereotype threat, high pressure
  - Positive: Supportive feedback, inclusive norms

y: Motivation/Performance (continuous outcome)
  - Objective: Test scores, task completion rates
  - Subjective: Motivation scales, satisfaction measures

ESTIMATION DETAILS
-----------------
Method: Pooled nonlinear least squares (NLS)
Weights: Inverse variance (sample size, precision)
Robustness: 
- IV estimation (F=18.4 first stage)
- Bootstrap SEs (999 replications)  
- 10-fold cross-validation (R²=0.91)
- Subgroup analysis (gender, age, education)

DATA ACCESS PROTOCOL
-------------------
Public data: ECB surveys, lab experiments - available online
Anonymized data: Synthetic datasets in repository (upon request)
Proprietary data: Available from institutions with approval

ETHICAL COMPLIANCE
-----------------
- GDPR: All personal identifiers removed
- Privacy: Differential privacy (ε=1.0) for sensitive variables  
- IRB: All human subjects research ethically approved
- Transparency: Complete methods documented above

SAMPLE SIZE JUSTIFICATION
------------------------
Power analysis: 80% power to detect δγ=0.45 effect (α=0.05)
Minimum detectable effect: 0.12 (smaller than observed 0.45)
N=1,237 sufficient for precise estimation (SE<0.10 for main parameters)
